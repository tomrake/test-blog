### [The source for info on MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
I refer to the [Detailed Install Guide](https://www.msys2.org/#installation) [Updating packages.](https://www.msys2.org/docs/updating/)

### Instructions
In MSYS2 shell execute `pacman -Syuu` follow the instructions about terminating the shell process, I just close the window, and say OK to the termination dialog.
Repeat until no more upgrades.
