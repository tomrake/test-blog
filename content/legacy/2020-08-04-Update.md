## The lockdown

I am in an isolated location with one of my parents.
COVID-19 changed all my planing.

It has been a long time since I have blogged.

## The routing setup

The router is a WRT54G and there is wired extension to a DLink WBR-1310.
I previously used another WRT54G at the extension position but that is in use
at my orgininal location, which I and my wife use on weekly basis.

It seems that the WRT54G on about a weekly basis stops serving dhcp addresses.
To counter that problem I have been allocating IP addresses statically.
This has reduced the downtime but I still have and android phone and table
which allocated addresses by dhcp.

## About org-mode

In the past months I have adoped emacs org-mode to document much of my work.
I use org-mode to keep the static ip addresses I mentioned above.
I have code documentation and planning in org-mode.
I should convert this blog over to org-mode.
