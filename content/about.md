### Why you should ignore this blog

Lately I have been interested in legal and political topics, concerning the internet and the platform Twitter.
During 2020 I became a fan of the [In Lieu of Fun Show.](https://inlieuof.fun/) this was a COVID time experiment by Ben Wittes of [Lawfare Blog](https://www.lawfareblog.com/) which is a wonderful resource on legal and nation security matter.

Previously this blog is mainly technical notes to myself, where things do not work
as expected. Lately I have been working/playing with LISP.

I have also worked:

* mostly in Windows but
* sometimes in Linux decades ago.
* in java and eclipse.
* in Pharo - Smalltalk.
* on renewable energy methods and markets.
* sometimes in R.
* mainly in emacs and seldom in vi.
* architectural drafting in Auto-CAD.
* 6502 programming on an Apple ][
* analysis of the waterpark industry
* Assembly on a CDC 6400
* a treasurer for a third party congressional candidate.
