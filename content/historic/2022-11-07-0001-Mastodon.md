On Twitter national security and political view are expressed by many of those I follow, and today many are moving to mastodon.
Last night while auditioning mastodon as a Twitter replacement, I was feeling I did not get the information I desired all the posts etc.
Mastodon is not heavy on the recommendation engine, if there is one, and you are more in control of what you see in your Home feed.
You are the algorithm.

About 15 years ago I was frustrated with Facebook why did it send me stuff and how do I find that stuff again.
On Facebook the users are the product, your attention is marketed to advertisers.

In the past I have used Twitter to review releases of other long form information web postings from government and companies.
I would follow those entities and get the latest information to review.

<p>
The MAGA King choose Twitter as the platform of 2016 to 2021.
I began to follow top MAGA media figures and anti MAGA sources.
2017 was a difficult transition, members of my family and acquaintances had been radicalized by the MAGA world, some were at the conspiratorial stage. 
Eventually I found a series of sources to follow based on my interests in legal, national security, military and government policies, and Twitter became hot.
I liked what the Twitter algorithm sent to me during 2020.
My review of these events, now in 2022, seems to support the view that the Facebook and Twitter algorithms were part of the outrage machine that entered the global discourse in 2015.

Twitter has had a difficult time being profitable.
The Billionaire Rocketman purchased Twitter with a billion dollar non-refundable deal, he then sued in Delaware and lost.
His first efforts were to drag the Twitter machinery through the sandy mud by firing people by email and then regretting is a few days later.
The people I value on Twitter started joining mastodon.

<h2 id="orgf48d339">Where is the Mastodon algorithm</h2>

<p>
My conclusion this morning is on Mastodon we build our own suggestion feed.
This has implications for many of us.
On Twitter I would often ignore many of the thread comments, how do even see these on Mastodon.
Are there comment threads?
