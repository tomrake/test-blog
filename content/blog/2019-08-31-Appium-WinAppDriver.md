In the redesign process for automation for cygwin in a docker container
the following needs to be considered.

## Considerations

- Appium or WinAppDriver based scripts
- The inclusion of WinAppDriver in target container.
- Configuration of WinAppDriver ports
- A developer language - Can I use common lisp?
- Scripting of automation

## Terms

- A Task a specified activity
- A Documented Structure a solution to Task.
- A Coded Structure a completely coded solution to a Task.

## Thoughts

- Proof of concepts demostrates how to perform a certain activity leading to
documentation and/or coding of a Task.
- Issues about ports and appium for direct WebAppDriver relate to "the stucture" of the proposed solution to a task.
- A Coded Structure is prefered over a Documented Structure.
