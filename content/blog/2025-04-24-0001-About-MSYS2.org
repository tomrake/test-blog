* MSYS2
[[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] is a collection of tools to build and host software on Windows.
* How I use MSYS2
- Bash under windows, script and command line work
- The version of emacs I use is from msys2
- My sbcl-compile is a series of bash scripts that compile latest version of SBCL.
