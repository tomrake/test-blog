## beautiful-jekyll is a fork of Jekyll-Now

Jekyll-Now was good effort by Barry Clarke and 
[https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) is an improved fork
of Jekyll Now that does not have the Double Scroll box problems. I would recommend starting any new github jekyll blog with [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/).
