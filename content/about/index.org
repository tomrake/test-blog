* Quick Intro

I am a 67-year-old, Computer Engineering graduate, Lehigh '79!  and East Stroudsburg High School '75! and Middle Smithfield School '69!

I recomend [[https://www.dogshirtdaily.com/][Dog Shirt Daily]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/@DogShirtTV][Dog Shirt TV]] where [[https://www.brookings.edu/people/benjamin-wittes/][Ben Wittes]] of [[https://www.lawfaremedia.org/][Lawfare]] along with guests discuss legal, political and, nation security matters.
This is a reboot of [[https://inlieuof.fun/][In Lieu of Fun Show]] which is what think tank people during the COVID lockdowns.
Today I do most of my political writing on  [[https://tomrake.substack.com/]]

* This site is mainly a blog

** It first started as a bunch of notes

While working on various coding projects I would note various things.

Previously this blog is mainly technical notes to myself, where things do not work
as expected. Lately I have been working/playing with LISP.
